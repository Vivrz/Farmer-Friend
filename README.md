# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It includes two official plugins for Fast Refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/).

# Farmer-Friend

Farmer-Friend is an innovative project designed to empower farmers by providing them with the tools and information they need to enhance their agricultural practices. This repository contains a collection of resources, scripts, and applications aimed at improving crop yield, managing farm operations, and promoting sustainable farming techniques.

## Features

- **Crop Management**: Tools to monitor and manage crop health, including pest and disease detection, soil quality analysis, and growth tracking.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Integrated weather forecasting services to help farmers plan their activities and mitigate the impact of adverse weather conditions.
- **Market Insights**: Real-time market data and analytics to assist farmers in making informed decisions about selling their produce.
- **Crop Prediction**: Crop prediction based on the season in which the farmer wants to grow their crop.
- **Pesticide Prediction**: Pesticide prediction based on the crop chosen by the farmer.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
